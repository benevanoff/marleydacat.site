# Data

## reddit

Data scraped from various reddit subreddits. Primarily the r/cats subreddit is used for negative examples.

I sample from various other subreddits to get counter-examples.

The `scrape_subreddit.py` script is used to scrape the current top 10 pages of content from a set of subreddits. Eg, `python3 scrape_subreddit.py cats,pics,food`

## google_images

In the beginning of this project, I hand selected and saved some images from google images.
